# Mosh DAO

This project is a fork of [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf), but aims to position itself a cross-blockchain experiment. We will utilize the Moshes as a symbol for a parachain future.

## Summary

### 1. 1 Mosh per day, 6 Different networks

#### A. Daily auctionns

This will be trustly auctioned on the official [app.mosh.lol](https://app.mosh.lol) website. All proceedes go the Mosh DAO treasury.

#### B. Each day, different network

- Monday: $ETH
- Tuesday $MATIC
- Wednesday: $FTM
- Thursday: $ARB
- Friday: $AVA
- Saturday: $ONE

#### C. DAO Mosh on Sunday

Every Sunday a Mosh will be randomly distributed to one of the holders of existing Mosh owners, or $MOSH holders. See code below.

### 2. $MOSH Token Launch (2022/01/01)

We will issue an official $MOSH token on the 90th day of the product launch.
This will be used to provide liquidity to the Mosh DAO, but also used as a participating right to the Mosh ecosystem.
In order to favor existing Mosh owners, we will airdrop $MOSH token at the time of ICO.

### 3. Incentivized community creation.

Every Mosh is copyright-free to be utilized under public domain.

## Main points

- The mosh artwork is public domain
- 1 mosh trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours forever, spanning 6 different networks.
- 100% of noun auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to Mosh DAO treasury
- Mosh treasury will be controlled by governance in the Mosh DAO
- 'Moshists' receive rewards in the form of nouns (33% of supply for first 30 days)

## Daily Mosh Auctions

We will generate one mosh, every day, forever on multi-chain
All proceedes will directly go the Mosh DAO Treasury.
Every 7th Mosh will go directly to the Moshist founder's wallet. (for the first 3 years)

## Mosh DAO

Mosh DAO will utilize a fork of the Compound Governance. The Mosh DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily Mosh auctions. Until the $MOSH token launch, all moshes are equal in terms of voting rights.

## Mosh Traits

The rarity of the Moshes are stated below.

## Moshists Rewards

'Moshists' are the group of 3 builders that initiated Moshists. Here are the Moshists:

- @shunkakinoki
- @littlemonastar
- @sh_tsj07

Since 100% of the proceedes will go to the Mosh DAO Treasury, every 3rd Mosh will be randomly airdropped to one of the Mosh DAO members (only the Moshists exists at the time of the launch)
