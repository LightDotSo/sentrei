# Mosh DAO

This project is heavily inspired by the works of [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf), but aims to position itself as an initiative to provide more ownership to the community, including non-owners of the Mosh NFTs. We will utilize the Moshes as a symbol for the means to drive community ownership forward - less margins for the middleman.

## Summary

### 1. Three type of "Moshes" generated each day

#### A. Auction Mosh

This will be trustly auctioned on the official [mosh.lol](https://mosh.lol) website. All proceedes go the Mosh DAO treasury.

#### B. Community Mosh

This will be airdropped each day towards a creator most deemed responsible for the distribution of the Moshes.
Solely governed and operated by the founders of Mosh DAO (see Moshists). for the first 30 days, later driven by open governance.

#### C. DAO Mosh

Each day a Mosh will be randomly distributed to one of the holders of existing Mosh owners, or $MOSH holders. See code below.

### 2. $MOSH Token Launch (10/1/2021)

We will issue an official $MOSH token on the 39th day of the product launch.
This will be used to provide liquidity to the Mosh DAO, but also used as a participating right to the Mosh ecosystem.
In order to favor existing Mosh owners, we will airdrop $MOSH token at the time of ICO.

### 3. Incentivized community creation.

Every Mosh is copyright-free to be utilized under public domain.
We will giveaway a free Mosh each day towards a creator most deemed responsible for community creation.
This can be

## Main points

- The mosh artwork is public domain
- 3 moshes trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours forever.
- 100% of noun auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to Moshes DAO treasury
- Mosh treasury will be controlled by governance in the Mosh DAO
- 'Moshists' receive rewards in the form of nouns (33% of supply for first 30 days)

## Daily Mosh Auctions

We will generate three moshes per day, meaning one every 8 hours, forever.
All proceedes will directly go the Mosh DAO Treasury.
Every 30th Mosh will go directly to the Moshist founder's wallet. (for the first 3 years)

## Mosh DAO

Mosh DAO will utilize a fork of the Compound Governance. The Mosh DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily Mosh auctions. Until the $MOSH token launch, all moshes are equal in terms of voting rights.

## Mosh Traits

The rarity of the Moshes are stated below.

## Moshists Rewards

'Moshists' are the group of 3 builders that initiated Moshists. Here are the Moshists:

- @shunkakinoki
- @littlemonastar
- @sh_tsj07

Since 100% of the proceedes will go to the Mosh DAO Treasury, every 3rd Mosh will be randomly airdropped to one of the Mosh DAO members (only the Moshists exists at the time of the launch)
